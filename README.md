# Merkalysis

## What is Merkalysis
Merkalysis is a basically a Marketing Tool. Merkalysis stands market analysis.<br>
Through this tool we are trying to reduce costs of marketing for small scale startups and bloggers.<br>
This tool can be used by anyone as it predicts the reach and perhaps the right hashtags to use for your post.<br>
Currently this works only for Instagram. We'll be expanding this soon.


## When was this made?
Hack performed during MS-Hacks 2.0 at LPU, Phagwara, Punjab.

## Why Merkalysis?
As mentioned above, merkalysis helps one to analyse their market reach before hand. This could potetntially save thousands of dollars every year as marketing is something that every company and/or blogger, especially small scale startups and bloggers do in order to increase their brand awareness.<br>
Marketing is something that will never die. Through Merkalysis, we provide easier marketing solutions. More precisely, we focus on organic marketing, i.e marketing without having to pay money over inorganic marketing.<br>
Usually people turn towards social media marketing. Not always do they get the reach that is promised to them. Sometimes, just to meet their targets, these social media platforms turn to clickfarms to have the post reached to the promised number which is unfair for the advertiser. Also, as mentioned earlier, this eats away a lot of money.<br>
Merkalysis predicts your market reach before hand.
### But How?
We make use of organic marketing techniques, like for example, usage of hashtags. Hashtags are powerful marketing tools through which you can reach the right audience not just in one particular region, but throughout the world.<br>
Not everyone uses hashtags in today's world. We look at promoting the usage of hashtags to reach a wider range of audience.<br>
We basically analyse the hashtags that you use.<br>
Through the hashtags that you use, we predict your reach.<br>
This might help you as it serves as the right tool for you to make your business related decisions.<br>
